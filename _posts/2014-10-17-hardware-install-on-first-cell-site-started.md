Earlier last week we began the hardware installation on our first cell site! Saturday we&#8217;ll continue installation. We hope to have the site operational by the end of the weekend, with KK4IOH Michael as our first initial user. The sector antennas will be at about 150 ft AGL, 435 ft MSL. We&#8217;ll have an entire cabinet to ourselves, so eventually we&#8217;d like to install a UPS, server, and rack mount switch. Initially, we&#8217;ll just have a switch and the radios. We&#8217;ll be going back to install an ADSB/transponder/GPS receiver and decoder appliance provided by [FlightRadar24](http://www.flightradar24.com/).

More coming soon &#8212; pictures, video, and performance data.

Thanks!
