This was granted late November, but we&#8217;ve still not shown up in the IRS&#8217;s EO tool. Nonetheless, here&#8217;s the exciting part:
  
&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to tell you we determined you&#8217;re exempt from federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501(c)(3). Donors can deduct contributions they make to you under IRS Section 170. You&#8217;re also qualified to receive tax deductible bequests, devises, transfers or gifts under Section 2055, 2106, or 2522.&#8221;

We&#8217;re excited about the opportunities that our new status brings us, and we look forward to better cooperation with other organizations. We&#8217;ve also setup a bank account and a PayPal account, so feel free to make a tax-deductable donation today via PayPal!
