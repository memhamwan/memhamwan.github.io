Thanks to your generous donations, we now have equipment to complete the link between the Southern College of Optometry cell site and the future East MemphisÂ cell site! The hardware includes:

  * 2x Mikrotik NetMetal 5 &#8211; 5Ghz AP or Client Super High Power 2000mW (3XMiMO) RB/921UAGS-5SHPacT-NM
  * 1x MikroTik RouterBOARD RB/2011UiAS-RM (complete with rackmount, USB port, power supply, fiber-enabled) RB/2011UiAS-RM
  * 2x Ubiquiti RocketDish 4.9-5GHz 30dBi Dual-Pol Parabolic Antenna (RP-SMA cables included) RD-5G30

The RB2011UiAS-RM will go to SCO, and SCO&#8217;s current managed switch will go to HIL, to eventually be marked as end-of-life for cell site deployment.

The point-to-point link is planned to run at 80 MHz channel width with -58 dBm receive signal, which is 12 dB rx relative. With it, we hope to get the full 866.6 Mbps 802.11ac dual chain data rate. The NetMetals we&#8217;re using are actually triple-chain, but we&#8217;ve not yet found a suitable antenna for them. We&#8217;re hoping to get somewhere between 300 and 500 Mbps of useful TCP throughput from the link, which would make it the fastest RF hop in our system so far!

We still need to fund the sector radios, sector antennas, router, lightning arrestors, and a few more incidentals. Hopefully we&#8217;ll soon reach that goal and have our second cell site deployed.
