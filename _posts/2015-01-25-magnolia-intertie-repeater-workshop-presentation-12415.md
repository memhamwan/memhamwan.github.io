They spoke specifically about the deployment currently in place in the Memphis Metro and how the technology could be applied alongside the Magnolia Radio Intertie group&#8217;s infrastructure. 

A proposal for partnership between the two organizations for exploration of north Mississippi HamWAN coverage was also publicly announced, with more information to come once the discussions are continued. HamWAN hopes to see the partnership not only increase user coverage of the Memphis Metro area, but also be a proof of concept for Magnolia&#8217;s consideration statewide.

Thanks to Frank Howell for the invitation. The slides from the presentation are available on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16XfwaVvgc8m0LA_68XY3YkQ5PLhPqKZ0dIG6mKr4xBs/edit?usp=sharing).

More pictures and video covering the event will be available soon.
