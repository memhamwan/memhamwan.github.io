Our first cell site is about half way purchased, and we&#8217;re currently meeting with potential site owners to discuss arrangements. Our site planning checklist is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AaExw2mh2qLWtIRZicbA5D2sI1wv5T2xRXZ1GrwJLik/edit#heading=h.67u85x4y4zvz). We have a few potential options in the Midtown region, for which our coverage would look similar to this:
  

  


<div id="map_canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;">
</div>

Our organization is being filed with the state and federal government at this point, and soon thereafter we will seek ARRL Affiliation for equipment and liability insurance opportunity.

Additionally, we&#8217;ve contacted a local ISP to begin working on space/connectivity/ASN access for our edge router.

Have a lead for any of this? Interested in helping? Be sure to [contact](http://memhamwan.org/?page_id=28) us!
