Thursday June 4th 2015, HamWAN Memphis Metro installed their first locally-peering edge router with [Ritter Communications](http://rittercommunications.com/). Located in Millington, TN, the edge router will provide lower latency access to the internet, while also reducing the hops between HamWAN&#8217;s internal network and network carriers.

&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to have a local ISP partner with HamWAN,&#8221; said Ryan Turner, President of HamWAN Memphis Metro, Inc. &#8220;Their community-focused approach has greatly helped further our project &#8212; without them, we would still be sending all of our internet traffic across the US,&#8221; added Turner. Ritter&#8217;s connectivity provides multiple upstream peers and runs on emergency power, making the edge router highly reliable. &#8220;They repeatedly exemplified their &#8216;Right by You&#8217; attitude in meeting with us and helping us with the installation,&#8221; said Turner. 

The edge router will be able to support about ten times HamWAN&#8217;s average traffic, and soon in the future it will be directly connected by a wireless point-to-point link to HamWAN&#8217;s existing site at Le Bonheur Children&#8217;s Hospital. MemHamWAN&#8217;s previously-used tunnel to a Seattle company for edge routing will be maintained as a backup system.

MemHamWAN estimates that this edge will support network expansion for the coming year and be a critical connection long term. While many of HamWAN&#8217;s activities are local to the network, management and servicing of the equipment frequently requires internet connectivity. In addition, connecting systems with other amateur radio networks takes place over the internet.

&#8220;While passing traffic within our network is impressive, most users want to communicate with others outside of the region from time to time,&#8221; said Turner. &#8221; And sometimes a microwave connection just isn&#8217;t feasible yet &#8212; whether you&#8217;re in a hole behind a ridge, or if you&#8217;re not able to put up the equipment. Internet connectivity lets all of these things just work. Ritter Communications is really helping us make this project happen.&#8221;
