This day in 2015, HamWAN deployed cell site equipment to their east Memphis cell site. Since then, we&#8217;ve added a 720p IP camera, another point-to-point link, network connectivity for a D-Star repeater, and a server has come and gone (due to climate control and power issues, it wasn&#8217;t the best site for a server). We continue to offer thanks to Tri-State Repeater Association for taking the equipment and hosting it for us at one of their existing sites.

As we continue to expand the network, this location will serve as a critical point of presence for our network. Today we have a router inside that only has one last port free (and it&#8217;s SFP!), and we don&#8217;t have monitoring of the UPS that&#8217;s providing power conditioning and emergency power for our equipment. We continue to have more work to do to improve the quality of HamWAN, but we&#8217;re excited by the consistent coverage of this site and look forward to it serving amateurs on HamWAN.
