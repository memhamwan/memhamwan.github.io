HamWAN Memphis Metro will be at the combined mid-south field day this year! We&#8217;ll have a tent setup, demoing our project to the public. We&#8217;ll also be offering HamWAN-provided public WiFi and a number of VoIP phones for the different operating stations.

Be sure to get the word out about this exciting event! See the flyer below.
