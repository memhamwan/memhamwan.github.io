This past Thursday, Michael KK4IOH and Ryan K0RET presented to MARA (Mid-South Amateur Radio Association) about HamWAN. About 20 amateurs were in attendance, with nearly half hearing about the project for the first time. They spoke generally about the project, while also providing updates to the group about progress towards network expansion, stability improvements, and local network peering. For the first time, we were able to have sector hardware available at the presentation, including the antenna, radio, shield, mount, and coax. The slides from the presentation are available on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SmuV1t7MH9SuJGTu4L4DKHv8BG21z6iUWJKXytvPUk0/edit?usp=sharing).

As part of our public outreach, HamWAN Memphis Metro visits and presents to local organizations monthly. If you&#8217;re interested in having our team come share information about our project with your group, please [contact us](http://memhamwan.org/contact/).
