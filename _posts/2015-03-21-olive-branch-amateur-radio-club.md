[Olive Branch](http://w5obm.us/) [Amateur Radio Club](https://www.facebook.com/obamateurradio) hosted Ryan K0RET and Michael KK4IOH this week for an Introduction to HamWAN presentation. They covered the project in general, some details of Memphis&#8217;s specific implementation, and how that related to those in northern Mississippi and DeSoto County interested in data or microwave uses for amateur radio. Also, methods of integrating with Broadband Hamnet were discussed. There are already two members of OBARC who have HamWAN nodes, and we look forward to having them and many more hams on network in the near future.
