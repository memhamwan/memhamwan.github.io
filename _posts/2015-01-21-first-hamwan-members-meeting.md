Hey folks,

It was great to see over 25 of you on Wednesday at our first HamWAN Memphis Metro members meeting! I hope that you all enjoyed the presentation &#8212; we certainly enjoyed meeting you. We invite all of you to join our mailing list and chatroom to continue the discussion.

As mentioned in the meeting, we have infrastructure on order to finish deploying at our east Memphis site. Once we complete fundraising, we can pay for the equipment and begin the installation. Since we met, we&#8217;ve had two new members sign up. The money from their membership dues are going directly towards equipment for network expansion &#8212; thank you for your contribution, from all of us! We hope to see and speak with many of you in the weeks to come and hope that we&#8217;ll be able to install equipment in East Memphis soon.

Thanks again for the strong showing. In a few weeks we&#8217;ll have a special members-only vote to determine when/where we want to set our recurring membership meeting.
