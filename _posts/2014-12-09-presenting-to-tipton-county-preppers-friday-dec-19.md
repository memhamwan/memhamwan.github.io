We will have a meet and greet, a 30 minute presentation, and a detailed Q&A session with equipment on hand. We hope to see you there! Be sure to [RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/Tipton-County-TN-Preppers/events/219089492/) if you plan to attend. We&#8217;ll be sure to get a video of the presentation as well as release the slides, though they&#8217;re no substitute for showing up in person!
