  * St. Jude event participation is delayed, instead we’ll mimic the event and do our own plan.
  * Temporary backhaul discussed, options to route through two other nodes in case that option does not pan out
  * No progress towards insurance, vanity, or affiliation; maybe escalate down to the assistant delta division director to check status of these things
